## [WEEK 10](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/tree/WEEK-10)

  [Java Week 10:Q1](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-10/Question101.java) The following code needs some package to work properly. Write appropriate code to import the required package(s) in order to make the program compile and execute successfully.

  [Java Week 10:Q2](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-10/Question102.java) Write the JDBC codes needed to create a Connection interface using the DriverManager class and the variable DB_URL.  Check whether the connection is successful using 'isAlive(timeout)' method to generate the output, which is either 'true' or 'false'.
```text
Note the following points carefully:
1. Name the connection object as 'conn' only.
2. Use timeout value as 1.
```

  [Java Week 10:Q3](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-10/Question103.java) Due to some mistakes in the below code, the code is not compiled/executable. Modify and debug the JDBC code to make it execute successfully.

  [Java Week 10:Q4](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-10/Question104.java) Complete the code segment to create a new table named ‘PLAYERS’ in SQL database using the following information.

| Coulmn | UID     | First_Name  | Last_Name   | Age     |
